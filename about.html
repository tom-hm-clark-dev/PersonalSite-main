          Aberystwyth University web development graduate with a passion for creating responsive and creative web designs, 
          and previous experience within a global e-commerce environment. At University I leveraged my experience working for an 
          e-commerce company to develop a website for a local music promotion company using Wordpress, used the JavaScript canvas 
          to create a game inspired by Space Invaders, and used Kotlin to create an Android app to log energy usage in kWh and 
          track energy usage statistics. Since graduating I have continued to improve upon my web design knowledge by building a 
          portfolio website for myself.

    <h2>
      Education
    </h2>
    <p>
      At Aberystwyth University I studied web development, where I learned key practical skills 
      such as web programming using HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, software engineering with the 
      languages C, Java and Kotlin, testing and debugging code using JQuery, creating and 
      managing relational databases by way of MySQL, and network administration and security 
      using Linux. In the theory modules I studied the business applications of these technologies 
      as well as examined e-commerce strategies.
      <br>
      <br>
      Some key projects I have completed as part of my university course include:
    </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li class="cvlist">
          A Wordpress based site for 
          Stitch Up Music Group, a Mid Wales based live music promotion company.
        </li> 

        <li class="cvlist">
          A JavaScript game loosely inspired Space Invaders.
        </li>

        <li class="cvlist">
          An educational quiz system as a member of a group project.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      At university I was also a founding member of a new society, BandSoc, a society dedicated to 
      bringing like-minded musicians together with the goal of getting more local bands together 
      in the Aberystwyth area.
